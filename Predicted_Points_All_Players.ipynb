    "# FPL Predicted Points: Data Pipeline and Odds Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook predicts Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points for all players in the next gameweek(s) by integrating historical FPL data, live fixture information, and bookmaker odds from Oddschecker. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Fetching:** Retrieve FPL teams, players, and fixtures from the official API.\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation:** Normalize and aggregate historical and current season stats for teams and players.\n",
    "3. **Odds Scraping:** Use Selenium to scrape match and player odds from Oddschecker.\n",
    "4. **Probability Calculation:** Convert odds to probabilities for match outcomes, player goals, assists, and saves.\n",
    "5. **Prediction Calculation:** Combine probabilities and historical rates to estimate expected points for each player.\n",
    "6. **Results Output:** Save detailed and summary results to Excel, and print top 5 predicted players by position."
